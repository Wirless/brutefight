# Migration Plan: BruteFight Code Restructuring

## Introduction
This document outlines the plan for refactoring the BruteFight game from its current monolithic structure into a more modular, maintainable architecture. The migration will involve breaking down the large game.js file into smaller, focused components with clear responsibilities.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (COMPLETED)
1. Create directory structure
2. Set up the Game class
3. Create basic documentation
4. Implement main entry point

### Phase 2: Manager Components (COMPLETED)
1. Implement PlayerManager
2. Implement ChatManager
3. Implement UIManager
4. Implement OreManager
5. Implement InventoryManager
6. Implement EquipmentManager
7. Implement AssetLoader

### Phase 3: Systems and Entities (COMPLETED)
1. Implement CombatSystem
2. Create Entity classes (Player, Ore, Item, etc.)
3. Implement rendering systems
4. Implement networking components

### Phase 4: UI Components (IN PROGRESS)
1. Implement various UI components (inventory, equipment, leaderboard)
2. Create UI helper utilities
3. Style and theme consistency

### Phase 5: Testing and Optimization
1. Implement automated tests
2. Performance optimizations
3. Browser compatibility testing
4. Bug fixes and refinements
